How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You can see which line has changed and trace the mistake that might have 
    taken place

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can see what changes you've made to your program

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Sometime it's just a draft and you don't want to commit that file yet. In
    Google docs, it saves automaticlly. But in Git you have control over when
    and what files you want to commit 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Google doc is used to work with document, and you usually working with one
    document at a time, rather than a system/program deals with hundred or 
    thousands of file. Commit a thousand file is a very tidious job rather than
    just commit hundred files at the same time
